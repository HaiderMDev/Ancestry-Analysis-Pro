GENOMESTUDIO:

#Go to the following taps:

Analysis > Report  and pick the last one which will take you into the reports 

#Towards the end, pick the following columns:
SNP
Chr
Position
SampleID
Top Allele1
Top Allele 2

#Do one sample at a time and it will print you a final report for each sample! If you don't do this and decide to do all of the samples in one report, then it won't fit the excel file! 
#Select between rows" 319556 - 653403 which only contain RSID's. This is after sorting by the first column.

----------------------------------Pre-Processing the RAW file---------------------------

#Make Genotype the first line, then:
#remove all the lines with "D" and "I"
#Then sort the file by RSID, and make sure each row has only one RSID value
#Then align the file in following column headers in this order: RSID/Chromosome/Position/Genotype
#Then move it to the Database folder for analysis and remove unnecessary files 

grep -v "D" ./DEMO.txt  > ./demo1.txt
grep -v "I" ./demo1.txt > ./demofinal.txt
rm ./DEMO.txt ./demo1.txt

#Take the d2 and make sure that there is only one RSID per row! Then save the file with the following name "Rawdata.txt"
sed 's/,/  /g' ./Rawdata_semi.txt > ./Rawdata.txt 
rm ./Rawdata_semi.txt
######################AT THIS POINT MAKE SURE OF THE FOLLOWING########################
#1. NO "I" or "D" in the Genotype Column
#2. Only one RSID in the RSID column
#3. Make sure you have the following column headers: "RSID/Chromosome/Position/Genotype"
#3. Merge the two genotypes that are in separate columns in excel, using the command "=Concatenate(E,F)"






-------------------------Generating ANCESTRY Raw File-----------------------------------

#Take the genotype data and use the "standardize" function to standardize it to be used with the DIYDodecadLinux64 program! This is done in R
R
setwd("/home/haider/Desktop/DATABASE 54/")
source('standardize.r')
standardize("Rawdata.txt") #this creates a file called "genotype.txt"

#copy "genotype.txt" to all of the folders:
for i in ./*; do cp -v genotype.txt $i; done

#Run DIY program in each of the folder with individual databases:
for i in ./*; do (cd ./$i/ && ./DIYDodecadLinux64 *.par); done






---------------------------After executing DIYdodecadLinux64----------------------------
#PRE-PROCESSING THE FILE:

#this will remove all spaces and line the text in each file
for i in ./*; do cat ./$i/genomewide.txt | sed 's/  / /g' | sed 's/  / /g' | sed 's/  / /g'| sed 's/  / /g'| sed 's/  / /g'| sed 's/  / /g'| sed 's/  / /g'| sed 's/  / /g'| sed 's/  / /g'| sed 's/  / /g' > ./$i/genomewide2.txt; done

#Remove whitespace:
for i in ./*; do sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' ./$i/genomewide2.txt > ./$i/genomewide3.txt; done


#AMALGAMATION:
#get the ancestry stuff from all databases in one file
head -n2 ./*/genomewide3.txt > ./amalgamate_ancestry.txt 

#remove empty lines from the beginning:
sed -i '/^$/d' amalgamate_ancestry.txt 

##this code will print everything from third column onwards!
awk '{$1=$2=""; print$0}' ./amalgamate_ancestry.txt > ./semifinal.txt 

#this will remove all lines with "<==" leaving only the text that you need!
grep -v "<==" ./semifinal.txt  > ./ancestry_semi.txt 

#This will remove uncesseary spaces so everything lines up. 
sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' ./ancestry_semi.txt > ./ancestry_information.txt


#remove unnecessary files
rm ./amalgamate_ancestry.txt
rm ./semifinal.txt 
rm ./ancestry_semi.txt
